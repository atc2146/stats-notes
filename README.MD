## Overview

## Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST)

### p-value
* In NHST, the [p-value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value) is the probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the results actually observed, **under the assumption that the null hypothesis is correct**.
  * The assumption on the null hypothesis is important!
  * A very small p-value means that such an extreme observed outcome would be very unlikely under the null hypothesis.

### Power
